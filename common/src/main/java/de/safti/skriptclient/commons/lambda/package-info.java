/**
 * The Package is taken from the Skript-Parser GitHub.
 * That is why you'll see broken Javadoc. These interfaces are completely unchanged.
 * It's added here instead of the parser repo, because this is an implementation.
 * The skript client parser is used for the parser, not any implementations.
